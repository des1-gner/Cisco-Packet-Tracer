!Frame Relay full mesh, inverse-ARP
!How do you know the topology is full mesh?
!only one network address covers the Frame Relay network
e.g. R1,R2 and R3 might all be part of 192.168.1.0/24
There is a connection between each pair
Traffic flows directly from each router to another router

!Always congifure these 2 commands

!
!Use eigrp network statements and 0.0.0.0 masks that match the !ip address on the interfaces
!use sh ip int brief to see the interface addresses
!
Router eigrp 1
Network 192.168.64.9  0.0.0.0 
Network 192.168.68.1  0.0.0.0 

&&&&
Advertise a default static route using EIGRP
&&&
Router eigrp 1
Redistribute static
!
&&&&
EIGRP Authentication
&&&
Int s0/0/1
Ip authentication mode eigrp 1 md5
Ip authentication key-chain eigrp 1 CHAIN_5
!
&&&&
eigrp cost - prefer one link over another
&&&&&
!s0/0/0 is not to be used by eigrp => make its cost very high by increasing the delay
int s0/0/0
delay 5000
!
!Note: a delay 5000  causes the delay to be 50,000 because the units are  10s of microseconds
&&&&
EIGRP route summarization
&&&
Calculate a summary of the routes
e.g. summary is   10.10.240.0 /20

!Configure eigrp to advertise the summary out each interface:
Int gi1/0/1

&&&&&
DHCP Snooping option 82 problem
&&&&
!Assume Sw1 connects to the dhcp client
!Sw2 is the next switch in the path to the dhcp server
!we assume that the dhcp server is a cisc0 router

Two commands needed for dhcp to work:
! trust packets with DHCP Option 82 on untrusted ports: 
!On Sw2
ip dhcp snooping information option allow-untrusted 

AND
!Configure the cisco router (DHCP Server ) to trust DHCP packets with option 82 set: 
!cisco router that is the dhcp server
ip dhcp relay information trust-all

What if a Windows server is the dhcp server (not a cisco router)
!turn off dhcp option 82 on every switch

!Sw1 and Sw2
no ip dhcp snooping information option

+++++++++++++++
week 6 HSRP
++++++++++++++
1) Using router interfaces 
e.g. gi0/1 is a layer 3 port
!on R1
Int gi0/1
Standby 4  ip 10.1.4.1
 Standby 4 priority 105
 Standby 4 preempt
 standby 4 track Gi0/0

!on R2
Int gi0/1
Standby 4  ip 10.1.4.1
 Standby 4 priority
 Standby 4 preempt

!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2) Using MLS routed ports 
e.g. Gi0/1 is a layer 2 port
Make gi0/1 a layer 3 port with an ip address
!MLS1
int gi0/1
 no switchport
ip add 10.1.4.2 255.255.255.0
!
!MLS2
int gi0/1
 no switchport
ip add 10.1.4.3 255.255.255.0
!
Then use same hsrp commands as for 1) above

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3) Using MLS SVIs
e.g. hsrp for vlan 40 hosts

Use the same commands as 1) above but
replace int gi0/1 with int vlan 40

• On Sw2 port Gi0/0/2, configure so that DTP sends a message that says that Sw2 Gi0/0/2 definitely wants to trunk.

! Sw2
Int Gi0/0/2
 Switchport mode trunk
!
• Configure the Sw0 fa0/1 to send a DTP message which will ask the port at the other end to trunk i.e. Sw0 port fa0/1 actively wants to trunk

! Sw0
Int fa0/1
 Switchport mode dynamic desirable
!

• Sw3 fa0/2 connects to a rotuer and  definitely wants to trunk. Turn of DTP on Sw3 because the router does not understand DTP

!Sw3
Int fa0/2
 Switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
!

week 2 Advanced NAT
Static NAT => PCs on the outside will use a single public address to access one of our internal servers
•	The FTP server (10.1.1.101) is statically translated to the public address  208.8.8.201

!R-SNAT
ip nat inside source static 10.1.1.101 208.8.8.201
!
Verify  show ip nat translation
!
Clear the NAT translation table before doing the next NAT task
!R1-NAT
clear ip nat translation *

+++
Static PAT => PCs on the outside will use the same public address to access two different internal servers. The port number will decide which server to use

Configure  Static PAT on the router R-SNAT to satisfy the following requirements:

•	The HTTP server (10.1.1.100) is statically translated to the public address  208.8.8.200, but only for port 80 browsing
•	The HTTPS server (10.1.1.105) is statically translated to the public address  208.8.8.200, but only for port 443 browsing

!R-SNAT
ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 208.8.8.200 80
!
ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.105 443 208.8.8.200 443

++
Static PAT => PCs on the outside will use two different public address to access the same internal server. The port number will decide which public address to use

!R-SNAT  
ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.106  443  208.8.8.220 443
!
ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.106  80  208.8.8.230 80

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
week 1a Task 1 SPAN, Switch Port Analyzer
++++++++++
• Configure SPAN on Sw1 and Sniffer 2, so that ping frames coming in or 
going out  port fa0/10 are monitored on port fa0/5
!
monitor session 1 source interface Fa0/10
monitor session 1 destination interface Fa0/5
!
!Also,edit the filter on the sniffer to monitor ping packets
Verify  Show monitor
!!
+++
week 1a Task 2 RSPAN, Remote SPAN
++
• Configure RSPAN session 3 with source on Sw1 so that ping frames coming 
in on
port fa0/10 are monitored on port fa0/2 on Sw2 .Use vlan 5 to do this

!Sw1 and Sw2
Vlan 5
Name RSPAN
Remote-span

!fa0/11 is any unused port on Sw1
monitor session 3 source interface Fa0/10 rx
!Sw1 reflector port is any unused port on Sw1
monitor session 3 destination remote vlan 5 reflector-port fa0/11
!
!Sw2
monitor session 3 source remote vlan 5
!
monitor session 3 destination interface Fa0/2
!!
Verify  Show monitor

week 1b Review Dynamic PAT
++++++++++
Task 1A  Configure  dynamic PAT , overloading on an interface, on the 
router R-NAT to satisfy the following requirements:

• Internal PCs with addresses belonging 10.1.1.128/25 may be 
dynamically translated to the public address in the R-NAT Gi0/0/1 
address (108.8.8.101)

These are the 2 PCs labeled as Dynamic
Use access list 10.

This is called Dynamic Pat using an interface address
!R-NAT
access-list 10 permit 10.1.1.128 0.0.0.127
!
ip nat inside source list 10  int gi0/0/1 overload
!
Verify
clear access-list counters
clear ip nat translation *
!
Show access-lists
show ip nat translation
show ip nat statistics
++
Task 1B  Configure  dynamic PAT, using a pool of public addresses, on the 
router R-NAT to satisfy the following requirements:
• Internal PCs with addresses belonging 10.1.1.0/25 may be dynamically 

translated to the public addresses in the pool called NATPOOL20

• This pool should include the 3 public addresses 131.1.1.1,  
131.1.1.2  and  131.1.1.3

Use the overload command so that thousands of connections can use each 
public address in the pool. This is called Dynamic Pat using a pool
!R-NAT
access-list 20 permit 10.1.1.0   0.0.0.127
!
ip nat pool NATPOOL20   131.1.1.1 131.1.1.3   netmask   255.255.255.0
ip nat inside source list 20  pool NATPOOL20 overload
